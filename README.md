## Description
Simple Python script and executable that auto-accepts match accept buttons for CS:GO, LoL, and other games. Uses pyautogui to identify and click on accept buttons when they pop up on screen. Script is structured such that it looks for whatever possible accept buttons that show up, given that the buttons are provided in the `images` directory.

## Installation

## Usage
1. Add the "accept button" in the **images** folder in the **dist** directory. 
2. Run the **script.exe** file in the **dist** directory.
3. (Optional) you can add more accept buttons by adding more image files (use .png) to the **images** directory.
